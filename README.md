Hello!, I'm a 16-year-old self-taught composer, programmer, and animator. if you are here, there are most likely 2 reasons: either you're here because you found this from my profile, or if that's the case, then feel free to look around and give me comments on how good this all is! otherwise, you're here because you're a company/studio looking to commission some of my work. In that case, you can look around the different places, and should you like my work, you can contact me using some of the information in [contact.md](./CONTACT.md), with all that said, enjoy the fruits of my labor!
