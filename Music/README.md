Hello! If you're in this folder then you're looking at my music! these are small samples that you can listen to so you can get a feel for what my music generally tends to sound like!
Alternatively, you can find a couple of other of my songs on my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzC66e3fxpkpnoL9vo0UQJQ) with the audio visualizers I made included!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're gonna download one of the files to listen to the song, I reccomend downloading the audio file, and then `Cover.jpg` and placing them into a folder so that the album artwork I made will work properly! thank you!
