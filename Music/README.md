Hello! If you're in this folder then you're looking at my music! these are small samples that you can listen to so you can get a feel for what my music generally tends to sound like!
Alternatively, you can find a couple of other of my songs on my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzC66e3fxpkpnoL9vo0UQJQ) with the audio visualizers I made included!
Or, you can pick from the links below for specific songs that i think are portfolio worthy off the bat!
